OS abstractions, mechanisms, and polices for:
- processes and process management
- threads and concurrency
- resource management: scheduling, memory management
- OS services for communication and I/O
- OS support for distributed services
- System software for data center and cloud environment

Theory + Practice

Sequence of Programming Projects:
- threads, concurrency, and synchronization
- single-node os mechanisms
  : inter-process communication, scheduling...
- multi-node os mechanisms
  : remote procedure calls(RPC)..
- experimented design and evaluation
