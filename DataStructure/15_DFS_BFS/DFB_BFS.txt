Application of DFS
1. Topological Sorting(I don't know yet) <----------------
2. In maze, find path(O)


Application of BFS
1. Shortest Path(Hard), MST for unweighted graph. <----------------
2. Peer to Peer Network(O)
3. Crawlers in Search Engines(I don't know)
4. Social Networking Websites(I can utilize)
5. GPS Navigation System(O)
6. Broadcasting in Network(O)
7. In Garbage Collection    <-------------------
   : BFS is used in copying garbage collection using Cheney's algorithm


Both can be used 
1. To test If a graph is bipartite(O)
2. Path Finding(O)
3. Detecting Cycle in a Graph(O)
4. Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm(I don't know yet)
